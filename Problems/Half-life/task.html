  <p>In nuclear physics, the&nbsp;half-life is used to describe the rate with which elements undergo&nbsp;radioactive decay. More precisely, it is the time required for an element to reduce in half.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Let's take an isotope of Radium (Ra) called radium-223. Its half-life is almost 12 days (11.43, to be exact). Write a program that calculates how many full half-life periods (in days) it would take for a certain amount of radium-223 to reduce to a specific value.</p> 
  <p><strong>The input format:</strong></p> 
  <p>The first line with the starting amount of atoms <strong>N</strong>&nbsp;(from 2 to 1,000,000), the second line with the resulting quantity <strong>R</strong>.</p> 
  <p><strong>The output format:</strong></p> 
  <p>The number of full half-life periods (in days)&nbsp;<strong>T</strong>&nbsp;it would take for radium-223 to reduce from&nbsp;<strong>N&nbsp;</strong>to&nbsp;<strong>R</strong>. That is&nbsp;if it would take at least 1 half-life period, write 12 and so on.</p>
