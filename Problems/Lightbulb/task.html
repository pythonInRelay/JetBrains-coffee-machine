  <p>Here's a class <code>Lightbulb</code>. It has only one attribute that represents its state: whether it's on or off.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Create a method <code>change_state</code> that changes the state of the lightbulb. &nbsp;In other words, the method turns the light on or off depending on its current state.&nbsp;The method doesn't take any arguments and prints a corresponding message:&nbsp;<strong><code>Turning the light on</code></strong> if it was off, and <strong><code>Turning the light off</code></strong> if it was on.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>Inside the method, you are also supposed to change the value of the attribute <code>state</code>.</p> 
  <p>[HINT]To produce the correct result, inside the <code>change_state</code> method check the current state of the lightbulb by accessing the <code>state</code> attribute.[/HINT]</p>
